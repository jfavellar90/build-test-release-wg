Context
-------

The work of putting out, and then maintaining, a new Open edX release is not a
simple endeavor, and would probably take more than a single person's full time
dedication even if a volunteer had such time to spare.

Thus, in the interest of spreading the workload with the members of the group,
a few key roles must be created and then assigned to volunteers.

---------
Decisions
---------

#. The following roles are hereby created:

   #. Group chair
   #. Release Manager
   #. Release Testing Coordinator
   #. Release Documentation Expert
   #. Bug Triager
   #. Community Liaison

#. The role descriptions will be added and maintained in this repository's
   README.

#. When volunteering, the role and its responsibilities are taken for the
   current release cycle; i.e., until the release in development is delivered
   by the group.  A single person can take on multiple roles, if desired, and
   also keep said role(s) after a release is made.

#. As volunteers are found, they will be added to the README for the cycle in
   question.

Consequences
------------

The distribution of tasks will make for a better and more maintainable release,
and also closer engagement with the community.
